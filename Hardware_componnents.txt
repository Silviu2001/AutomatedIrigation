Used components:
    1.Arduino Uno microcontroller development board:
        a.used to turn a 3 volt digital signal from the NodeMCU to 5 volt in order to power the water pump 
        b.used to supply 5 volts to the relay module
    2.NodeMCU :
        a.Used to connect to the internet through the esp8266 in order to submit http requests to the website
        b.Takes analog reading from Water Level Sensor
        c.Takes digital Reading from Soil Hygrometer
    3.Soil Hygrometer:
        a.Used to interpret the resistance measured by the probe, it has a potentiometer in order to set a threshold for the digital output pin
    4.Soil Hygrometer Probe
        a.Pins covered in conductive material used to measure the resistance of the soil and in turn itâ€™s humidity
    5.Water Level Sensor
        a.Used to measure the water level, the sensor is covered in lines of conductive material and the more water is in contact with the material the more current passes
    6.Relay Module
        a.Used to prevent flyback from the water pump 
        b.It is an electrically operated switch the input pin controls whether the pin C is connected to the pin N0
    7.Water Pump
        a.A simple DC motor that spins a fan in order to pull water through an opening and push it through a hose to the soil
